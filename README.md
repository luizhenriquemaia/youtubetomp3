Program to download audio from youtube videos

I'm making this program because i didn't found one without errors and a massive advertisements.
Be free to copy or whatever, i don't wanna money from this.

The initial idea for this software was read a .txt file and download the musics from there, but i already made a option using beatifulsoup for download without use a browser,  maybe in future i gonna make a user interface with pyqt4.

So make sure you download all the libraries, install ffmpeg for the conversion and creat a .txt file and make a folder for the downloads and you 
should be fine.

Thanks for read this,
IT'S ALWAYS WEDNESDAY MY DUDES.
